# TEXT-CLASSIFICATION-USING-GOOGLE-CLOUD
Text classification is the process of labeling the natural language text with relevant categories and in simple term simply extracting generic tags from the messy or unstructured text. Defining a category of a paragraph by reading it, would waste a lot of time; instead, we can classify it and categorize it by text patterns or simply comparing it with the bag of words. There are a lot of practical uses of text classification. One that we use every day by using our email services in which the emails get categorized by “spam” or “not spam,” another is to classify a review about movies or products whether it is a positive or a negative review by using a bag of words. Let’s say if we are searching something on stack overflow or want to answer a question that is only related to cloud and the question isn’t categorized and so we have to go through all of the content and decide whether it falls into a cloud category or not.
